## Technical test for Android

In this repository you'll find a classic list/detail application. Code is messy, full of weakness and so outdated in terms of Android best practices. You mission is improving it as you want. Check it out, detect defects and try to solve them. Dealing with legacy code is endless task, so if you don't have enough time for apply all changes you'd like, please write it down and let us know.

> :warning: Please don't start project from scratch. You must iterate over current codebase. Fork the repository and send us your improved version.

Below you can see the technical stack we use at Mango. It would be nice if you're familiar with it, but we'll also glad if you show us something different or trendy. New tools are always welcome :smile:

- Kotlin
- Kotlin DSL
- MVVM + Databinding
- MVI + Databinding
- MVVM + Compose
- Architecture components
- Retrofit
- Coroutines (Although RxJava remains in some parts...)
- MockK
- Picasso
- Jackson
- Timber
- Local store (realm, shared preferences)
- ConstraintLayout
- Custom components
- Deeplinks
- App modularization is in our roadmap. If you have experience in this area, you can show us what you know, up to you.

If you're not comfortable using that tools, no worries! Code as you fancy. The purpose is just having a space for discussing technical stuff together. For further doubts, please contact us at eqp.ecommerce.movilidad@mango.com

If you feel stuck and don't know how to start, there are some areas could be improved:

- We're Kotlin first!
- Still using Asyntask!
- It seems like no SOLID principle is respected.
- Too many responsabilities in the Activities. Split it out!
- Just showing first 20 characters. Could network call be paginated?
- UI is pretty simple. Show character's image!
- There are no test :shit:

We hope you enjoy dealing with :spaghetti: code!
